# Backstage-Talks

This project was developed as a personal training exercise in web development, focusing on the use of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. The design and concept were inspired by a challenge found on [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/), a platform dedicated to helping developers improve their front-end skills by building real-world projects.

## Overview

The main goal of this project was to hone my skills in front-end development, particularly in achieving responsive and adaptive designs. I adopted a 'Mobile First' approach to ensure that the website provides an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web pages.
- **SCSS**: Styling, utilizing features like variables, nesting, and mixins for more efficient and maintainable CSS.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic elements without the use of frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- Implementation of modern CSS techniques for layout and styling.
- Interactive elements powered by vanilla JavaScript.
